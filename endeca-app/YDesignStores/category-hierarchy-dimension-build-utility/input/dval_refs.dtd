<!--
	The DVAL_REF element specifies how specific dvals should behave.

	INERT				(TRUE | FALSE)		#IMPLIED

	Setting the INERT attribute to TRUE makes this dval non-navigable.
	For more information on non-navigable dvals, refer to the Endeca
	Documentation.

	COLLAPSIBLE			(TRUE | FALSE)		#IMPLIED

	COLLAPSIBLE is used in combination with the THRESHOLD attribute
	on DIMENSION_REF. Marking an internal dval as collapsible has
	the effect that if the navigation state would return more than
	DVAL_THRESHOLD (as specified in the DIMENSION_REF of this dval's
	dimension) child dvals as edges, the collapsible dval is returned
	instead. If less than THRESHOLD children would be returned, the
	collapsible dval is ignored and its children are returned.
